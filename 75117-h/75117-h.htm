</div>

<p><i>Writing and Rewriting</i> is based on the conviction that
college freshmen can be taught to see and to correct
their own errors and faults.</p>

<p>Criticism by means of marginal numbers, referring
to pieces of advice in a rhetoric or a manual, has long
been utilized to economize the instructor’s time. It has
not been generally realized, however, that this method,
which requires the student to inspect and rewrite a
faulty sentence in the light of an illustration in his book,
is successful also in teaching him to rewrite faulty sentences
before he submits his manuscript to his instructor.</p>

<p>The best device to encourage the student in self-correction
is the preliminary copy or rough draft. This
may be written rapidly in pencil on theme paper or on
scratch paper, with lines far apart to leave room for
modifications. After this is written the student should
read it with his eyes open for the appearance of his
pet blunders, and should do his own rewriting. If the
rough draft is submitted with the finished copy, the
instructor can discover whether the student is endeavoring
to correct his own faults.</p>

<p>The best way to use <i>Writing and Rewriting</i> in class
is to copy the faulty passages or to clip and paste them
on cards. In class the student, using only the slip, may
then be required to write the correct version on the
blackboard, later reciting and specifying the fault, or
the principle of style which is violated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>[viii]</span></p>

<p>In colleges where the marginal numbering of errors
and faults is supplemented by personal conferences, the
swiftest improvement will be found to follow the practice
of requiring the student, before the conference, to
copy his faulty passages on a new sheet of theme paper,
to copy also the admonition indicated by the marginal
number, and to rewrite each passage in accordance with
the admonition. A file of these sheets will reveal
whether the student is improving or standing still.</p>

<p><i>Writing and Rewriting</i> has several relatively novel
features. Chapters IV and V make it possible to criticize
by marginal numbers the most common violations
of the principles of the whole composition and of the
paragraph. Although the admonitions criticize faults,
the book contains few “don’ts.” Instead, the advice
given is positive, constructive, and concrete. Each number
refers to only a single fault. Few admonitions fill
more than two lines of type. It has thus been possible
to insert a criticism of every fundamental fault found
in freshman themes. Probably every number ought to
be used at least once in every hundred themes. The
division of sentence criticisms into chapters on Correctness,
Clearness, and Vigor is logical and obvious. The
numbering of admonitions is not consecutive, but a
new hundred begins with each chapter as a help in more
quickly locating the number desired. Additional copies
of the index to the admonitions will be furnished free on
request to instructors who wish to paste it on a sheet of
cardboard to facilitate their work in criticizing themes.
The list of suggestions for subjects is a compilation of
the practices of many successful teachers.</p>

<h1>WRITING AND REWRITING</h1>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Chapter_I"><span class="smcap">Chapter I</span><br>
<span class="smaller">WHY LEARN TO WRITE</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The four main reasons for learning to write are:</p>

<p>1. Writing is one of the best ways to make other
persons think or feel as you do.</p>

<p>2. Every educated person is judged frequently and
severely by the correctness and skill displayed in his
writing.</p>

<p>3. The more you learn about writing the more you
will enjoy reading.</p>

<p>4. Good writing gives pleasure, not only to the reader
but also to the writer.</p>

<p class="tb">1. The ability to write clearly and convincingly will
be of great help to you after you leave college. Whatever
your field of activity, your ultimate success will
depend in some degree on your ability to make other
persons think or feel as you do. Writing is one of the
best ways to attain this end.</p>

<p>Many professional men and women find that success
depends not only on their knowledge, but even more on
the skill and clearness with which they can present
their knowledge. Lawyers write briefs and arguments.
Judges write opinions. Clergymen write sermons.
Teachers, doctors, and engineers get their new ideas<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
before members of their professions by writing papers
for publications of various kinds. The results of their
experiments and researches are almost invariably presented
to their colleagues in writing.</p>

<p>To attain eminence in one of the learned professions
it is necessary for a man’s colleagues to think highly
of his professional knowledge and attainments. It is
not always possible for the leaders in your profession
to know you personally, but if you can write they soon
know what manner of man you are. The scholarly articles
that a young professional man gets printed correspond
to the home runs that are knocked by a bush
league baseball player, but there is this difference. The
sand lot baseball player may have made his impressive
looking records against sand lot pitching and may fail
dismally when he faces better opposition, but if a young
professional man has the mental ability and the skill
to produce contributions to knowledge in his field it
makes no difference where he lives or under what conditions
he has done his work. As he moves up to his
big league he finds conditions more and more favorable
for his continued growth and development.</p>

<p>College graduates everywhere are being expected more
and more to assume positions of leadership in all matters
that pertain to community betterment. Sometimes they
are candidates for office; more often they are directors
of the chamber of commerce of their city, or of
some similar civic enterprise. Written statements,
annual reports, appeals for public support for a worthy
cause, letters to newspapers, circulars, and bulletins are
almost the only way a public spirited citizen can get his
ideas before the other members of the community. If
he can write clearly and convincingly he gets things<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
done that would not be done if he expressed himself
haltingly and incoherently when he took pen in hand.</p>

<p>Up-to-date farmers and business men use printed and
typewritten matter to get new business, to hold and increase
old business, to adjust complaints, and to collect
money. Every salesman has to write reports to his firm.
Formal bids for all kinds of business are submitted in
writing. Most busy executives prefer to receive the
ideas of their subordinates in writing, and the subordinate
who submits the largest number of good ideas in
this way is the one who is likely to be promoted most
rapidly. Many executives have to depend on letters
and bulletins in directing large numbers of subordinates
or in directing subordinates who cannot frequently be
brought together. If you want to be paid for what you
know rather than for what you do, learn to write.</p>

<p>Other things being anywhere nearly equal the man
who can write gets ahead fastest in the business, political,
or professional world. The man with a new idea—whether
it is a new type of automobile engine or a plan
for insuring hogs—can make a success of it far more
quickly if he can write clearly and convincingly. The
next time you see a copy of <i>Who’s Who in America</i>
note the list of publications that follows the name of the
successful man. The ability to write has dollar and
cents value whether or not you ever wish to sell any of
your manuscripts. You must be able to write to get
to the top.</p>

<p class="tb">2. Why do you suppose that almost every help
wanted advertisement that offers a salary of more than
$1200 or $1500 a year contains the phrase, “Apply by
letter only”? The answer is that from one hundred
letters it is easy to select the half dozen or so that come<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
from persons qualified for a position rather than for a
job. Applicants who write poor letters are never considered
for good positions.</p>

<p>The activities of the social world continually call for
letters—letters of invitation, of acceptance or declination,
letters to a hostess thanking her for her hospitality,
letters of congratulation and of condolence. Any new
person to whom you write will judge what sort of man
or woman you are from your first letter. Uneducated
persons may have well furnished houses in the exclusive
residential districts of the city, and they may wear
thousand-dollar fur coats, but their written words betray
the fact that they are not accustomed to associating
with educated persons.</p>

<p>Students who can write get better grades in college
courses than do students who cannot express themselves
with pen, pencil, or typewriter. Written reports, term
papers, and examinations all call for ability to write.
It is essential not only to have the information that
should be included in such compositions but also to be
able to express your knowledge so that the instructor
involved will know that you know.</p>

<p class="tb">3. The better you write the more you will enjoy
reading. You can actually know personally only a few
persons, and they will for the most part be your neighbors
and business associates. A love for good reading
is the best friend you can have. Reading will make you
intimate with all the great men and women who are
now alive or who have ever lived. These great ones of
earth—the clever, the entertaining, the thoughtful, the
lovable, the brilliant, the courageous—have set down
in books a permanent record of what they observed,
thought, and dreamed. To get the fullest flavor and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
greatest benefit from the words they have put on paper
you need to be something of a writer yourself. The
writer best appreciates the good writing of others, just
as the amateur musician gets more pleasure from a
symphony concert than does the average person in the
audience. The football player sees fine points in a football
game that are lost on the spectator who never tried
to box a tackle or elude an end. The girl who makes
her own clothes can see distinctions in gowns that all
look alike to her brother. It takes the craftsman in
any field of endeavor to appreciate the work of a master.</p>

<p class="tb">4. Your mother has, at the bottom of a trunk or
bureau drawer, a bundle of letters that your father
wrote to her when they were young. Every little while
she reads them all again. She also keeps the letters he
writes her now when he is away from home. Your
letters to your mother will not be destroyed either. The
better you write, the more pleasure you will give to the
persons you love. Letters of commendation, congratulation,
or condolence when done well are treasured for
years, and are a never failing source of pleasure to those
who receive them. It is worth something to give pleasure
of this sort.</p>

<p class="tb">But the greatest pleasure of all in writing is the
pleasure that comes to you yourself. To get real enjoyment
from writing you should write on a subject you
know thoroughly or on one that interests you—preferably
both. Write without reserve; call things by their
right names. Use care in selecting the exact word to
express your meaning. Write clearly, concisely, and
vividly. Be definite and particular rather than indefinite
and general. Use incidents freely to illustrate your
points. Be forceful and picturesque. Write so that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
anyone who knows you could pick your written creation
out of a thousand written by others on the same subject.</p>

<p>Write something you are proud of and you will get
more pleasure from it than from almost anything else
you ever did. Even though you may not yet have
realized it, writing is a great deal more fun than going
to the theater, dancing, or watching a football game.
The greatest thrill in life comes from seeing one whom
you love create something. The next greatest comes
from creating something yourself. Create something
in writing that truly represents you and you too will
experience this joy.</p>

<span class="smaller">HOW TO WRITE</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The successive steps in writing are:</p>

<p>1. Have a subject that appeals to you, and write for
an actual reader.</p>

<p>2. Gather all the material your subject demands.</p>

<p>3. Arrange your material in the most effective order.</p>

<p>4. Write as fast as you can.</p>

<p>5. Revise, recast, rewrite what you have written.</p>

<p class="tb">1. Write on a subject which interests you and one
that you know something about. Good writing will not
result merely from trying to satisfy an instructor. You
can write well only if you have a compelling reason for
writing; if you desire to convince, inform, or entertain
a definite reader.</p>

<p>Know the state of mind you want your reader to be
in when he finishes reading your composition. Write
for a definite reader such as a college freshman, a high
school student, an automobile owner, a ten-year-old boy,
a proprietor of a retail store in a town of from 15,000
to 20,000 inhabitants. It will often be helpful if, after
you choose the general class to whom your writing is
addressed, you select one individual you know and keep
him constantly in mind while you write. Thus instead
of writing for a ten-year-old boy write for your brother
Robert.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<p>Choose a subject that can be covered in the number
of words at your disposal. If you are writing a four-hundred-word
theme, “The American High School” is
a poor subject. It would take a series of volumes to
exhaust the possibilities in that title. Even eliminating
a large portion of it by taking the topic “High School
Newspapers,” “High School Debating,” “High School
Dramatics,” or “High School Athletics,” helps but little.
Narrowing any one of these subjects so that it applies
only to your own high school still leaves you with more
material than can well be put into a short theme. Good
subjects for such themes are “The First Time I Faced
an Audience,” “The Best Play I Ever Made,” “How
I Felt When My Story Appeared in the School Paper,”
and “The Most Exciting Play I Ever Saw in a Baseball
Game.”</p>

<p>To take another example, “Cooking” is a subject
broad enough for a Mrs. Ralston, a Mrs. Lincoln, or a
Miss Farmer. “Making Desserts” is too comprehensive
for any but an exhaustive treatise. “Making Ice
Cream” requires at least a booklet. Good short theme
subjects would be “How I Make My Favorite Sherbet,”
“How to Make Chocolate Ice Cream without
Cream,” or “How to Make Ice Cream Roll with a
Frozen Whipped Cream Center.”</p>

<p class="tb">2. Reflect, read, ask questions, observe in order to
gather material which will enable you to carry out your
design. Gather, as applied to material for writing, implies
a go-and-get-it attitude. Gathering material requires
a physical as well as a mental search. Do not
expect material to come to you; go after it. Talk with
persons who know. Read what they have written.
Good writing is most likely to result when the writer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
fuses his own experience and observation with the experience
and observation of others. Gather all the material
possible without trying to decide, while you are
getting it, what is important and what is not. Keep
your mind, your eyes, and your ears wide open. Get
details and get plenty of them. Steep, saturate yourself
in your subject.</p>

<p class="tb">3. After you have gathered the material, discard
everything that will not help you to produce the effect
you are trying for. Then if there are any gaps in your
composition, gather more material to fill them up. Some
writers get the best results by putting a plan on paper before
starting to write; others let a plan take more or
less definite shape in their minds, but do not try to set
down any hard and fast outline. The reason for not
making a hard and fast outline is that a curious thing
often happens to any writer who has written much. He
finds—on occasion—that his composition seems to
write itself. The characters he thought he had created
have minds of their own and refuse to let him treat
them like puppets. His thoughts seem to be alive and
to exist apart from him. They insist on expressing
themselves in their own way. An experienced writer
does some of his best work when he seems to be merely
the medium through which ideas are seeking to translate
themselves from whatever world it is they inhabit
to this one. If, on the other hand, a writer is continually
consulting a plan, his ideas and characters never take
things into their own hands.</p>

<p>Write for someone to read. Put yourself in that
reader’s place and see if your writing is producing the
desired effect. Begin your composition with the details
that will most effectively attract his attention and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
arouse his interest. Continue writing so that you will
retain his attention and interest. Stop when you have
said all you have to say.</p>

<p class="tb">4. Write rapidly and at white heat. If pertinent
ideas keep coming to you forget about your plan. Get
your inspiration on paper before it cools. If you finally
find a system—or even a lack of one—that enables
you to write fast and at the same time to feel that you
are creating something, do not let anyone talk you into
trying some other plan. Stick to your own.</p>

<p class="tb">5. Revise at leisure, but ruthlessly, in cold blood,
and continue to revise, rearrange, and rewrite indefinitely
until the finished product satisfies you.</p>

<p>Make the final draft absolutely correct. Avoid especially
the common faults that denote the semi-illiterate
man or woman. If you make errors that would not be
made by a twelve-year-old child, your composition will
get scant consideration from an intelligent reader. While
revising, question everything, spelling, grammar, choice
of words, punctuation; question the usefulness of each
idea, and the arrangement of the parts of the completed
composition.</p>

<p>Start writing soon enough to give yourself ample
time for revision. Let the first draft get cold before
you look at it again. If you wait several days after
the first draft is finished you can approach your own
writing as objectively as if it had been done by someone
else. It will then be much easier to question every letter,
every word, every phrase, every sentence, every paragraph,
every idea, besides the whole composition and
each of its parts.</p>

<p>Make everything in your composition justify itself.
Whenever you are satisfied to do mediocre work the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
rest of the world is satisfied with the valuation you
have set on yourself. Be your own severest critic.
Show your own writing no mercy. Some of the world’s
most successful writers of advertisements as well as of
novels have rewritten their best work time and again
before giving it to the public. What reads smoothly
takes hours of toil to produce.</p>

<p>Many good instructors insist on receiving two copies
of every composition from each student; one a rough,
lead pencil draft, and the other the finished manuscript.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Theater in America</span></p>

<p>Between the years 1750 and 1814 many events took
place which either helped or hindered the establishment
of a permanent theater in America.</p>

<p>One of the big events that helped establish the
theater in America was the coming of the Hallam company
of actors. This company was made up of English
actors who came from the West Indies. The company
consisted of twelve adult members and three children.
Every member of the group had ability as an actor,
and, consequently, the company was successful. They
first played at Yorktown, Virginia, in 1752. Then,
after a season in Philadelphia, they went to New York.
After a three months’ stay in New York, they returned
to the West Indies, where Mr. Hallam died. Here a
Mr. Douglas reorganized the company and with them
returned to this country.</p>

<p>Douglas, often called the “theater builder,” did much
for the future theater. He was a man of great strength
and courage. Besides being a capable manager, he
was also a good actor. Douglas built the first theater
in America at Williamsburg, Virginia, and the first
permanent theater at Philadelphia. He also built theaters
at Annapolis and at Newport.</p>

<p>The greatest difficulty which the play companies had
to overcome was the increasing opposition of some of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
the people toward the theater. Throughout the country
people were fighting against the theater. Especially
was this true of the people of the North. The Southerners
were fun-loving and pleasure-seeking, and the
theater offered them a place of amusement. In many
towns, however, laws were passed against acting. The
opposition of the people was not directed so much
toward the theater itself as toward the gambling and
immorality which accompanied the theater of that day.
Folders were distributed among the people explaining
why the theater was not approved of and gradually
the gambling and immorality disappeared. After this
the theater improved and theater-going became better
thought of throughout the country.</p>

in tiny sheaths, but how many of us know why
they should be? In the first place, the cat is descended
from a wild animal whose way of obtaining food was
to kill its prey and then tear it to pieces. Naturally
when this animal struck into the dead body with its
claws, the claws, being hook-like, would tend to remain
fast. But nature found a way of overcoming the difficulty
by incasing the claws in sheaths so that while
the paw of the animal is still inside the carcass, the
claw can be withdrawn into the sheath and the paw
removed without hindrance. Perfection in nature extends

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Why Take Boxing?</span></p>

<p>Boxing is a very interesting sport. When the child of kindergarten
age first attends school he has his first experience with
fighting. This happens at every meeting of boys and continues
into the teens. Nearly every real American boy
wants to learn how to protect himself, and a course in boxing
is the best way to learn defense. In boxing, the individual
learns where the best blows are planted and also how to ward
off these blows. If a boy knows these punches he will not
be imposed upon by his companions. Even in later life men
often become quarrelsome and come to blows, but the man<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
who has learned the fundamentals of boxing always comes out
in the lead. If every man knew how to box, robberies would
be less frequent because the victims would be less timid and
would give battle to the bandits instead of allowing themselves
to be held up by highwaymen. Thus, defense is an important
element in boxing.</p>

<p>Moreover, boxing, besides aiding in defense, is a healthful
sport. The body is developed greatly after one goes out for
boxing as is shown by the increase or decrease in weight, as
the case may be. The weight decreases if one has been in
the habit of taking no exercise as he begins training, but the
weight soon increases again as the body makes the proper readjustments.
Persons who are fleshy soon lose their superfluous
fat. With the adjustment of weight the muscles are
developed. The arms and shoulders with their continuous
exercise in delivering punches and warding off blows are highly
developed. The muscles of the body are developed to a great
extent by the continuous twisting and bending of the body.
The legs become firmer and carry the body with ease after
practice in boxing because of the rapid forward, backward,
and side movements necessary.</p>

<p>Again, the body is developed in quickness by the practice
of boxing. The boxer’s mind is made more alert by the
habitual practice. The muscles of the body also increase in
quickness. They respond instantly to the will of the mind
and thereby increase the ability to advance and retreat rapidly,
to deliver and ward off punches. When the boxer has developed
this quickness of sensory and muscular organs, he can
grasp the intent of his opponent’s actions more quickly and
govern himself accordingly.</p>

<p>Boxing is a very well-known sport. It is widely popular
both in Europe and in America. It originated several centuries
ago. The main reason for the popularity of boxing is that
it is a very interesting sport. The spectator is held by the
rapid action of the boxers. In the early days of boxing the
men were slow and relied chiefly upon strength, but the modern
boxer has developed speed and uses short, quick blows. If
the boxer of the past should fight the boxer of the present, the
affair would be very one-sided, because the latter would soon
tire out his opponent by his quickness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span></p>

<p>Besides being interesting because of the violent action that
is a natural part of the sport, it is also interesting from the
point of view of the money-maker. Thousands of dollars are
spent every year in developing winners. This was shown
in our latest match, the Dempsey-Carpentier fight, in which
many thousands of dollars were involved. An international
spirit also prevails when boxers from two countries meet. This
was indicated in the same match when all the Americans yelled
for Jack and all the foreigners for Georges.</p>

<p>Boxing has grown in popularity through the ages because
of its aid to health and because of its interesting features.</p>

with books and toys. But the toys would
sometimes become tiresome, and I would look wistfully
through the fence at the children playing across the
street. I would have liked to join them or to have
them come over—but there stood the fence. I learned
to read and gradually built up a play world of my own
until one day I realized that I liked the fence. I no
longer cared to play with the other children, and when
I went to school I found that I could not play with
them. The fence had followed me. The years outside
the fence have changed me somewhat, but still whenever
I am in a group of young people I have a feeling
that I am not one of them. I want to stand back and

For purposes of ministering the better to the various
demands made upon it, it is made up of a number of
colleges, as the college of medicine, the college of law,
that of engineering, of liberal arts, of commerce, for
instance, each college being in charge of an officer called
the dean. The colleges, in turn, are composed of various
departments, such as the department of Romance
languages, of art, and of home economics; these are
under the charge of officers called department heads
or professors. And finally, each department presents
many courses of instruction, like French, rhetoric,
European history, and architectural drawing, each
course being taught directly by an officer called an
instructor or professor. Hence, although from the
variety of its interests and the complexity of its
activities it would seem that a university is an awkward,
ungainly organism, nevertheless, if one examines
it closely, one finds that it is a highly organized and
smoothly running machine.</p>

<span class="smaller">GRAMMAR</span></h2>

</div>

<p>In this short discussion of grammar the attempt is
not made to discuss exhaustively all the features of
English grammar. The purpose is only to survey and
to identify all the elements of an ordinary sentence. The
definitions are few, and are descriptions rather than
formal definitions. The parts of speech are treated as
they become important in the structure of the sentence.
Such a treatment of essentials as this is necessary
partly as a review, but especially because a teacher
and a student cannot discuss many of the commonest
sentence faults unless they have a mutually intelligible
terminology. A student must be able to recognize such
grammatical elements as a subject or an object, a participle
or an infinitive, a phrase or a clause, in order
to produce correct and effective sentences. There is a
minimum amount of grammatical knowledge without
which a writer cannot rewrite his compositions so as to
avoid the commonest errors and imperfections.</p>

<h3>What Grammar Is</h3>

<p>Grammar is the study of the structure of sentences,
and of the forms and functions of words and word-groups
within sentences. In simple terms, grammar is
the examination of the machinery of language.</p>

<h3>Sentences</h3>

<p>Sentences make assertions (declarative sentences), or
ask questions (interrogative sentences), or give commands<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
(imperative sentences), or express emotion (exclamatory
sentences). Written sentences begin with a
capital letter and end with a period, a question mark, or
an exclamation point.</p>

<p>The most common kind of written sentence is that
which makes an assertion. This kind, called declarative,
may well be taken, therefore, as the most available
basis for the discussion of the machinery of the sentence.
The word sentence in this chapter will accordingly mean
a declarative sentence.</p>

<h3>The Parts of a Sentence—Subject and Predicate</h3>

<p>A sentence has at least two parts—a subject and a
predicate.</p>

<p>The <i>subject</i> is that part which designates what the
assertion is about.</p>

<p>The <i>predicate</i> is that part which makes the assertion.</p>

<p>Many students earn their way through college.</p>

<p>It is obvious that <i>Many students</i> designates what
the assertion is about, and is therefore the subject.
<i>Earn their way through college</i> makes the assertion
about <i>Many students</i>, and is, therefore, the predicate.</p>

<p>Although the sentence may contain other elements,
although the subject or the predicate or both may be
long and complicated, and although the elements making
up the subject and the predicate may be variously
arranged, nevertheless every normal declarative sentence
contains these two parts, and can be divided into these
two parts.</p>

<h3>Subjects</h3>

<p>The fundamental word or element in the subject is
a noun, a pronoun, a gerund, an infinitive, or a clause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span></p>

<p>A <i>noun</i> is simply a name word. It may signify a
person or an animate being (Frank, boy, dog), an object
(tree, box), a color (red), an action (walking, step,
discussion), a quality (goodness), an abstract idea
(truth, space), a general idea (speed, thing), to name
only a few kinds of nouns. But it is always the name
of an individual or of a class of persons or things.</p>

<p>A <i>pronoun</i> is a substitute or symbol word which
signifies a noun which is either expressed near the pronoun
or implied by the circumstances (he, it, who, anyone,
I, you).</p>

<p>A <i>gerund</i> is a noun made by adding the suffix -ing to
a verb (walking, hoping, sitting, being).</p>

<p>An <i>infinitive</i> is a form of a verb, usually preceded
by the word <i>to</i>, often used to name the action signified
by the verb (to think, to have gone).</p>

<p>A <i>clause</i> is a sentence element consisting of a subject
(in the nominative case) and a predicate (with the verb
in a finite form—that is, not an infinitive or a
participle).</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>1. <i>Noun</i>:</td>
    <td>Time flies.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2. <i>Pronoun</i>:</td>
    <td>He arrived late. Everybody was late. I can do it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3. <i>Gerund</i>:</td>
    <td>Standing on the corner made him cold.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4. <i>Infinitive</i>:</td>
    <td>To tell the truth was easy.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>5. <i>Clause</i>:</td>
    <td>That he hath wronged me doth appear in this. Where he stood makes no difference.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h3>Predicates</h3>

<p>The fundamental word in the predicate is the verb.</p>

<p>A <i>verb</i> is a word—or a word-group—the function
of which is to assert something about the subject.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The tide rises.</p>

<p>The sun shone.</p>

<p>I bought a book.</p>

<p>The box is small.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span></p>

<p>The verb may consist of one word—as in the examples
given—or it may consist of a group of words,
called a verb-group, containing sometimes as many as
five words. This verb group consists of one, two, three,
or four auxiliary verbs, followed by a form of the verb
expressing the meaning or sense. The form of the sense-verb
is an infinitive, a present participle, or a past
participle.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The moon will rise.</p>

<p>The moon is rising.</p>

<p>The moon has risen.</p>

<p>He may light the lamp.</p>

<p>He is going to light the lamp.</p>

<p>The lamp at last was lighted.</p>

<p>The lamp has been lighted.</p>

<p>The lamp may have been lighted.</p>

<p>He may have been going to light the lamp.</p>

</div>

<h3>Structural Parts of the Predicate—Objects</h3>

<p><i>Intransitive verbs</i> are those which, like <i>rise</i>, make
assertions the action of which does not involve any person
or thing other than the subject.</p>

<p><i>Transitive verbs</i> are those which, like <i>light</i>, make
assertions which involve some person or thing other
than the subject in the action of the verb. In the
sentence <i>He lighted the lamp</i>, <i>lamp</i> is such an <i>object</i>.</p>

<p>The same verb may sometimes assert one, and sometimes
the other kind of action.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The door opened.</p>

<p>He opened the door.</p>

</div>

<p>Some transitive verbs make an assertion which involves
two nouns, both signifying the same thing or person.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The club elected Frank president.</p>

</div>

<p>Some transitive verbs make an assertion which involves
two different objects or persons.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I gave Frank an apple.</p>

<p>She bought Frank an apple.</p>

<p>I told him a story.</p>

</div>

<p>Here <i>apple</i> or <i>story</i> is the object directly affected by
the action of the verb, and is, therefore, called the
<i>direct object</i>. <i>Frank</i> or <i>him</i> designates the person for
whose benefit the action of the verb affects the direct
object, and is called the <i>indirect object</i>.</p>

<h3>Copulas and Complements</h3>

<p>Still another kind of verb, called a <i>copula</i>, though it
does not take a direct object, makes only part of the
assertion. The rest is made by means of another word
(or element) which characterizes the subject but which
is an essential part of the assertion. In fact, the
<i>complement</i>, as the element completing the verb is
called, is the most significant part of the predicate;
the verb is merely a bit of machinery by means of
which the complement is turned into an assertion.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The sky is red.</p>

<p>The dark shape was a house.</p>

<p>The car looks cheap.</p>

<p>He is in the house.</p>

<p>Home is where the heart is.</p>

</div>

<p>In these sentences, <i>red</i>, <i>a house</i>, <i>cheap</i>, <i>in the house</i>,
and <i>where the heart is</i>, are parts of the predicate,
though they characterize the subject. Such elements
are called <i>complements</i> because they complete the assertion
of the verb; if adjectives, they are called <i>adjective<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
complements</i>, or better, <i>predicated adjectives</i>; if nouns,
they are called <i>noun complements</i>, or <i>predicated nouns</i>;
if clauses or phrases, they are called <i>complements</i>, or
<i>predicated phrases</i> or <i>clauses</i>. The verbs by means of
which these complements are predicated are called
<i>copulas</i>.</p>

<h3>Modifiers</h3>

<p>Almost every word in the sentence is capable of having
its meaning described, restricted, emphasized, or
toned down in some way—that is, any meaning in the
sentence may be characterized or modified.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Heavy automobiles run smoothly.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Heavy</i> both describes and restricts <i>automobiles</i>.</p>

<p>Words which characterize nouns in this way are called
<i>adjectives</i>.</p>

<p><i>Smoothly</i> describes and restricts run.</p>

<p>Words which characterize verbs are called <i>adverbs</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Very heavy automobiles run much more smoothly.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Very</i> emphasizes <i>heavy</i>. A word which thus characterizes
an adjective is called an <i>adverb</i>.</p>

<p><i>More</i> characterizes <i>smoothly</i>. <i>Much</i> characterizes
<i>more</i>. A word which characterizes an adverb is called
an <i>adverb</i>.</p>

<h3>Prepositional Phrases</h3>

<p>Nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs are
also frequently described or limited in the same way by
an element or group of words called a <i>prepositional
phrase</i>. This usually consists of a noun, pronoun, or
gerund whose exact relationship to the modified word
is shown by means of a <i>preposition</i>. The preposition is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
placed before the modifying noun or pronoun and its
adjective modifiers.</p>

<ul>
<li>At home</li>
<li>In the house</li>
<li>With large tires</li>
<li>Over rough roads</li>
</ul>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Heavy automobiles with large tires run smoothly over rough
roads.</p>

</div>

<p><i>With large tires</i> is a prepositional phrase, consisting
of the preposition <i>with</i> and its object <i>tires</i>; the phrase
modifies or characterizes <i>automobiles</i>.</p>

<p><i>Over rough roads</i> is a prepositional phrase which
characterizes <i>run</i>.</p>

<p>A prepositional phrase characterizing a noun is called
an <i>adjective prepositional phrase</i>. One characterizing
a verb is called an <i>adverbial prepositional phrase</i>.</p>

<h3>Subordinate Clauses</h3>

<p>A <i>clause</i> is any part of a sentence consisting of a
subject in the nominative case and a predicate containing
a verb in a finite form (not a participle or an
infinitive). Some clauses are used as nouns; others are
used to characterize or modify nouns, pronouns, verbs,
adjectives, or adverbs. Clauses used as nouns are called
<i>noun clauses</i>. Those used as adjectives are called
<i>adjective</i> or <i>relative clauses</i>. Those used to modify
verbs, adjectives, or adverbs are called <i>adverb clauses</i>.</p>

<h3>Noun Clauses</h3>

<p><i>Noun clauses</i> may be used in practically any construction
in which a noun is used.</p>

<h3>Adjective Clauses</h3>

<p><i>Adjective clauses</i> are those which modify a noun or
a pronoun.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Heavy automobiles which carry large loads run smoothly.</p>

</div>

<h3>Adverb Clauses</h3>

<p><i>Adverb clauses</i> usually modify a verb. They characterize
the verb in several different ways.</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><i>Time</i>:</td>
    <td>He hurt his wrist when he fell.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><i>Place</i>:</td>
    <td>I put the glass where I could reach it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><i>Cause</i>:</td>
    <td>We stopped the car because it was raining.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><i>Concession</i>:</td>
    <td>Although it was still dark I awoke.</td>
  </tr>

    <td>He struck the vase so that it fell over.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><i>Manner</i>:</td>
    <td>They work as they please.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Adverb clauses of degree, and sometimes those of
manner and of result modify an adverb or an adjective.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The cherries tasted sweeter than they looked.</p>

<p>He sawed the plank as carefully as he could.</p>

<p>We traveled so slowly that I despaired of reaching our
destination.</p>

</div>

<h3>Participles</h3>

<p>The <i>participle</i> is any form of the verb used as an
adjective. There are several forms: <i>rising</i>, <i>risen</i>, <i>having<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
risen; raising, raised, having raised, being raised, having
been raised.</i></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The rising sun awakened me.</p>

<p>The fallen tree lay across the ravine.</p>

<p>The wind, howling a gale, swept the sea.</p>

<p>Twisting out of my hands, he escaped in the darkness.</p>

<p>The tree, twisted and broken, rotted away.</p>

</div>

<h3>Infinitives</h3>

<p>The <i>infinitive</i> is usually preceded by its sign, <i>to</i>,
but after some verbs (<i>do</i>, <i>shall</i>, <i>will</i>, <i>may</i>, <i>can</i>, <i>dare</i>,
<i>help</i>, <i>need</i>, <i>see</i>, <i>hear</i>, <i>feel</i>, <i>let</i>, <i>make</i>, <i>bid</i>) and after the
expressions <i>had better</i>, <i>had rather</i>, it is usually the pure
or root infinitive without <i>to</i>.</p>

<p>There are six forms of the infinitive:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th><i>Simple</i></th>
    <th><i>Progressive</i></th>
    <th><i>Passive</i></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><i>Pres.</i></td>
    <td>to take</td>
    <td>to be taking</td>
    <td>to be taken</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><i>Perf.</i></td>
    <td>to have taken</td>
    <td>to have been taking</td>
    <td>to have been taken</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The infinitive has various uses:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><i>Subject</i>:</td>
    <td>To command is his ambition.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><i>Predicated noun</i>:</td>
    <td>To know is to act.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><i>Object of verb</i>:</td>
    <td>I prefer to travel slowly.</td>

<h3>Conjunctions</h3>

<p>It is often necessary or desirable to join together two
or more similar words, elements, or clauses in a sentence.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
Two nouns constituting the subject, for example, may
have the same assertion made about them.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Time and tide wait for no man.</p>

</div>

<p><i>And</i>, which joins <i>time</i> and <i>tide</i>, is a <i>conjunction</i>.</p>

<p>Two adjectives, two verbs, two adverbs, two prepositional
phrases, or two clauses may be joined together
with a conjunction.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The flag is colored red and blue.</p>

<p>Time came and went.</p>

<p>Men and women laughed and cried.</p>

<p>The rains descended, and the floods came.</p>

<p>The automobile is fast, but the airplane is faster.</p>

</div>

<p>Words like <i>and</i> and <i>but</i> are conjunctions.</p>

<p>Conjunctions which connect words, phrases, or clauses
of equal grammatical value are called <i>co-ordinating
conjunctions</i>.</p>

<p>The most frequent are <i>and</i>, <i>but</i>, <i>or</i>, <i>nor</i>, <i>for</i>.</p>

<p><i>Subordinating conjunctions</i> are used to join a subordinate
clause—noun, adjective, or adverb—to another
clause or to some word in another clause. At the
same time they show the exact significance and bearing
of the subordinate clause.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>We heard that the train was wrecked.</p>

<p>He came because I called him.</p>

<p>He remained though he wanted to go.</p>

<p>If it rains I shall stay at home.</p>

</div>

<p>Subordinating conjunctions are also sometimes used
to join participles or adjectives to the rest of the sentence.
In such cases, the participle or the adjective
modifies a noun.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Though moving slowly, the train was gaining.</p>

<p>Though faithful to his master, the dog was shot.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span></p>

<h3>Structure of Sentences</h3>

<p>According to certain features of their structure, sentences
are classified as <i>simple</i>, <i>compound</i>, or <i>complex</i>.</p>

<p>A <i>simple sentence</i> is one consisting of a single clause
or assertion.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Time flies.</p>

<p>Time came and went.</p>

<p>Time and tide wait for no man.</p>

<p>Men and women laughed and cried.</p>

</div>

<p>The subject of a simple sentence may consist of one
noun or pronoun with its modifiers, or of two or more
nouns with their modifiers. In the latter case, the subject
is called a <i>compound subject</i>. Similarly, the predicate
may contain one verb or two or more verbs. Occasionally
a sentence will have a compound subject and
a compound predicate, as in the last example given.</p>

<h3>Compound Sentences</h3>

<p>A <i>compound sentence</i> is one which consists of two or
more assertions of equal grammatical value—that is,
neither assertion is grammatically subordinate to the
other or to any part of the other.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The rain descended, and the floods came.</p>

<p>The automobile is fast, but the airplane is faster.</p>

</div>

<h3>Complex Sentences</h3>

<p>A <i>complex sentence</i> is one which contains not only a
main assertion (or more than one), but also one or more
subordinate assertions—that is, it contains one or more
assertions which are grammatically incorporated as a
noun or an adjective or an adverb into the main clause
or into another subordinate clause.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I saw that he had finished.</p>

<p>Heavy automobiles which carry large loads run smoothly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span></p>

<p>The weather will be what fate determines.</p>

<p>He broke the stone that he might find a fossil.</p>

</div>

<h3>Absolute Elements</h3>

<p>Most of the elements of a sentence have a clear grammatical
relation to one another. But there are pieces
of structure which have no evident relationship to anything
else.</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><i>Noun absolute</i>:</td>
    <td>He lay down, his heart heavy with sorrow.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>Hat in hand, he came down stairs.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The <i>participle absolute</i> is more frequent.</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><i>Participle absolute</i>:</td>
    <td>This said, he sat down.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>One of them having fallen, the rest ran away.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>The teacher absenting himself, there was no school.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h3>Parenthetical Elements</h3>

<p><i>Parenthetical elements</i>, like <i>so to speak</i>, <i>it is hoped</i>,
<i>it is reported</i>, <i>they remark</i>, which have no grammatical
connection with the rest of the assertion, occur frequently.
Sometimes they are inclosed within dashes,
sometimes within parentheses, sometimes within commas.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>This action, it is expected, will produce results.</p>

</div>

<h3>Flexibility of the Sentence Elements</h3>

<p>Although the sentence has a normal order—subject,
verb, object; or subject, verb, complement—it is rich
and varied in the possibilities it possesses of variety and
rearrangement, especially in the position of adjective,
participial, and adverbial elements, and in the case of
adverb clauses.</p>

<h3>Inflections</h3>

<h3>Verb Conjugation</h3>

<p>Verbs are conjugated to show person, number, tense,
mood, and voice. Most of these changes are shown by
the use of auxiliary verbs, which are placed before the
infinitive or the past or present participle of the sense-verb.
The combinations are called verb-groups.</p>

<p>The language spoken and written by educated persons
and by trained writers in all parts of the English-speaking
world has certain forms and usages to which everyone
must conform if he wishes to be recognized as a
well-educated man or woman. Conformity to the word-forms
and to the sentence structure of this widespread
language is called correctness.</p>

<p>Sentences exist for the purpose of conveying thought
from one mind to another. The manner of their expression
must, therefore, be such that the thought expressed
is obvious and unmistakable. Otherwise, sentences not
only fail of their purpose but often lead to confusion, to
misunderstanding, and even to disaster. The quality
which renders their meaning obvious and unmistakable
is called clearness.</p>

which first pointed out that the wearing of the green
cap by first year men was a college tradition and must
be upheld, then explained that the wearing of the cap
was left to the honor of every freshman, who was expected
to purchase one and use it according to the rules
of the past two years, which state that the cap must
be worn every day until six o’clock at night, when it

<h3>PRACTICE</h3>

<p>1. Football is a game for the psychologist, and recognizing
this coaches in the past few years have paid an increasing
amount of attention to the mental attitude of
their players. (500)</p>

<p>2. The freshmen gathered at Lake Austin in the afternoon to
plan the bombardment of B hall, and in spite of the
fact that the excitement on the campus during the
early evening promised an interesting conclusion to the
day’s events, nothing unusual happened to break the
monotony until half past two in the morning, when
word was brought to the waiting sophomores that the
freshmen had assembled on Brackenridge field and were
preparing for the attack. (501)</p>

<p>3. Francis Neilson will give a talk at eleven Wednesday
morning in the room of the historical society. He will
talk on contemporary political and economic problems.
(502)</p>

<p>4. The Y.M.C.A. membership contest has been finished. It
extended for three weeks. Keen interest was shown by
the rivals for first place. Reuben Melin won, and
Clarence Koski was second. (503)</p>

<p>5. The programs for the hop have attractive covers of gold
felt with a black “I” in the center. Ogle’s ten-piece
orchestra will furnish music for the dance, which will
be in Varsity hall. Coach and Mrs. George D. Hanshaw
and Prof. and Mrs. Oscar J. Walters will
chaperon. The money cleared from the hop will buy
blankets for the sixteen men who won football letters.
(504)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span></p>

<p>6. It will be some time before the new plans are ready. It
is not known just where the new biological building will
be located. It was first proposed to place the building
at the northwest corner of the campus. (505)</p>

<p>7. To advocate the use of good English both in speaking and
in writing, does not necessarily mean that one is a
stickler for all the technical rules and eccentricities
of the grammarian. Although a semicolon once figured
as the essential question in a noted lawsuit in
Texas, a person may overlook many of the rules of
punctuation and still not cause any great harm to himself
or to his associates. A split infinitive may be the
bane of an English instructor’s life, but that error does
not damn an individual to eternal perdition. The
use, however, of accurate and clear English, in the
larger meaning of the term, should be encouraged as a
matter of efficiency as well as of refinement. (506)</p>

<p>8. Bauer is disgusted with the world, like many writers of
his class. (507)</p>

<p>9. Football is a great game, there is no denying that. (508)</p>

<p>10. Sometimes the girls become so interested in the work that
they cast aside their forceps and handle earthworms,
sheep eyes, pig hearts, grubs, frogs, and starfish with
their fingers. (509)</p>

<p>11. He said that to be a successful engineer imagination and
precision are necessary. (510)</p>

<p>12. A number of paintings, both in oil and in water color, including
works by Rembrandt, Rubens, Van Dyck,
Turner, Guido Reni, and other old masters as well as
several canvases by more modern painters were the
gift of Mrs. Mark Swanson. (511)</p>

<p>13. The first issue of uniforms was made Wednesday, when
237 men were equipped. (512)</p>

<p>14. Twenty-five candidates for membership in the University
Players were recommended by the judges at the tryouts
and were later elected. (513)</p>

<p>15. It may be understood that the successful end of such
a lengthy piece of work, which involves factors that
are undreamed of by those inexpert in such matters,
is hailed by an author with joy. (514)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span></p>

<p>16. It is safe to say that a better trained group of gridiron
warriors never donned the moleskins. (515)</p>

<p>17. Although the declamatory contest is only a few days off,
very few students have entered their names with Miss
Hogan. (516)</p>

<p>18. He agrees to furnish each child with a complete outfit and
a promise to replace all lost balls. (517)</p>

<p>19. There is no underlying motive or problem to be solved,

</div>

<p>New words and expressions, as well as new uses for
old words, are being added to the English language daily.
Likewise words and expressions once current are continually
being discarded. The question that confronts
any writer is, what words and expressions are now accepted
as standard. In difficult cases only persistent
consultation of the best dictionaries and a careful study
of the practice followed by the best writers now living
and by reputable publishing houses will furnish the correct
answer. The practice followed by the majority of
the leading writers and publishers of the present day
determines good usage.</p>

<span class="smaller">SPELLING</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Correct spelling marks the well-educated man or
woman. This simple fact constitutes the reason why one
must learn to spell.</p>

<p>English spelling offers difficulty partly because it is
somewhat archaic—that is, because pronunciation has
changed since spelling became fixed by printers about
three hundred years ago; partly because the English
alphabet is inadequate—it has only twenty-six characters,
and there are forty-two sounds in spoken English.</p>

<p>But however irrational may be the spelling of many
English words, every student must master spelling. Nor
is this a difficult task if attacked with persistence and
determination. The chief obstacles are carelessness and
lack of courage. Of the 450,000 words in the largest
dictionaries, probably not more than one thousand are
commonly misspelled by any one person—even the
worst speller alive. Completely mastering a few words
each day for one year, therefore, will enable any one to
become a good speller.</p>

<p>But no short cut method has ever been discovered
which will give skill to the writer who finds spelling
difficult. Every separate word which he habitually misspells
must be thoroughly and permanently learned by
a distinct effort of the memory, aided by regular practice.
Practice, in fact, is the only means of acquiring
fluent and permanent control over one’s pet failings.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
But the memorizing and the practice may well be facilitated
by an intelligent attack on the problem.</p>

<p>Human beings remember things in different ways, or
in a combination of different ways. Some remember
most easily and clearly what they have carefully looked
at; these are of the visualizing type. Some remember
what they have heard spoken aloud; these are of the
auditory type. And others remember best certain motions
which their muscles have performed; these are of
the motor type. It follows that some persons learn to
spell most easily by looking carefully at a difficult word
letter by letter or syllable by syllable; others by hearing
it spelled aloud or by spelling it aloud; and still
others by writing it over and over. But of whatever
type a person may be, he learns best by combining all
three methods, and by assiduously practicing the last,
for the only time he needs to spell is when he is writing.</p>

<p>The problem of spelling can be mastered by writing
every word five or ten times while the writer has his
eyes fixed upon the correct form and is spelling the word
aloud. Practice on the same word for three successive
days is almost certain to fix it for all time in the
memory.</p>

<p>The weak speller cannot dispense with a dictionary.
Asking a fellow student how to spell a word marked
incorrect by an instructor is fatal, for the fellow student
is often as ignorant as the questioner. Look up the
misspelled word in <i>Webster’s</i>, the <i>Standard</i>, or the <i>Century
Dictionary</i>.</p>

<h3>RULES</h3>

</div>

<p>Marks of punctuation are used for the purpose of
making the meaning of sentences unmistakable. It is
not sufficient that sentences be grammatically correct,
clear, and vigorous; they must also be perfectly punctuated
if their meaning is to be unmistakable. A writer
must, therefore, observe the rules of punctuation if his
writing is to be intelligible.</p>

<p class="center">I</p>

<p>I had been going to St Lukes Hospital in Charleston S C
every day for two weeks to visit my brother John who had to
undergo a serious operation Dr R L Spitzenberg one of the
best surgeons in the city was in charge of the case one day
it was I think March 12 1919 I asked the doctor when John
might be taken home he exclaimed my dear sir how can you
expect to move a man who is as weak as your brother is
naturally I was disappointed but John was more then disappointed
for he had become very tired of the hospital routine
he sighed deeply he turned his face to the wall and wept
sobbingly when he had become somewhat quieted a nurse
came in with his evening meal she was rather small not particularly
pretty and unusually brusque I thought in manner
the meal consisted of a small well-cooked steak hot baked
potatoes and a combination salad I sat beside the bed as he
tried to eat and wondered why they gave him such heavy
food if he were so weak finally I said nurse are all patients
given the same diet not two minutes before she had been
staring out the window in a vacuous sort of way at my
question however she turned and with no apparent change in
her manner remarked how should I know Ive just been
taken on.</p>

<p class="center">II</p>

<p>The lecturer said in part let me begin by quoting the
hounds of spring are on winters traces and the mother of
months in meadow and plain fills the shadows and windy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
places with lisp of leaves and ripple of rain could anything
more precisely convey the restless sensitive mood of spring
I can think of nothing he Swinburne the author seems to
have grasped the very essence of spring here and made it
live forever in his lines let me pause here a moment to suggest
that if anyone of you is looking for poetry that really
sings try Swinburne he will always satisfy the ear but poetry
is not all sound however it must if it is to appeal popularly
have rhythm to be sure nevertheless this rhythm must never
be allowed to become monotonous try reading Popes Rape of
the Lock for instance aloud what was it Wordsworth said
poetry was emotion recollected in tranquillity or something
like that wasn’t it indeed nothing could be more easily demonstrable
Bret Harte for example in Gabriel Conroy describes
a snow storm to perfection one finds himself floundering
through the drifts as truly as if he were actually in the midst
of the storm yet Harte wrote the passage long after he had
undergone the experience set forth and far from the scene
itself in fact he wrote of a storm in the West in midwinter
while sitting calmly at his desk in New York in midsummer.</p>

<p>In putting your ideas upon paper you must follow
certain customs which good taste and convenience have
established as correct at the present time. Since manners
change from generation to generation, however,
and since writing machines and printing methods are
constantly being improved, some of these customs necessarily
vary. The ensuing rules, therefore, have been
composed in accordance with the best present usage and
are passed on to you as describing those customs which
are least subject to change.</p>
